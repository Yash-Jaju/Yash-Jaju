Its a tuition management software where you can add a student deatails, remove a student record from database, mark and check attendance, Check the fee structure as well as keeping the track of fee paid by a particular stdent, also you can check the details of a student and also edit them. The most important thing which a student needs to do in this is that to remember his registration number, each and everything related to him can only be accessed through his registration number. 

A student gets to know his registration number as we enter his/her details in the "Add Student" section and press "Insert Record" the program will say his/her registration number. Also when you pay a certain amount of fees the program will say aloud the amount of fee paid.

You will have to replace ******** with your MySQL password and Location of the image of icon with the actual path.
